description: "Join us on Wednesday at the Starknet London Meetup to learn how
  Visa's been experimenting with account abstraction.  Nikola Plecas, Senior
  Director of VISA Crypto, will be with us to discuss the details.  He'll
  cover:  Starknet's native Account Abstraction (AA) compared to EOA. The
  uniqueness of AA in Starknet and what it unlocks. How Starknet compares to
  other networks for payments. And much more!  Following the talk from Nikola,
  we'll have drinks, nibbles and networking with fellow Starkpilled Londoners.
  Make sure you don't miss this one!"
